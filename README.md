# My Portfolio

A simple personal portfolio site I built to showcase my work. Nothing fancy — just clean HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

## What's Here

- **Dark & light mode** — toggle switch in the header, your preference sticks around
- **Responsive layout** — works on phones, tablets, desktops
- **Smooth scroll animations** — powered by GSAP
- **Project image sliders** — auto-rotating screenshots for each project
- **Contact form** — ready to wire up to a backend
- **Mobile menu** — hamburger that actually closes when you tap a link

## File Structure

```
index.html    # All the content
style.css     # Styling + theme variables
script.js     # Menu, dark mode, animations
images/       # Project screenshots and profile pic
```

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

Or view it live at [bjadhs.github.io](https://bjadhs.github.io)

Built with vanilla everything. No React, no build step, no nonsense.
